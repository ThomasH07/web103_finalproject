# Milestone 2

This document should be completed and submitted during **Unit 6** of this course. You **must** check off all completed tasks in this document in order to receive credit for your work.

## Checklist

This unit, be sure to complete all tasks listed below. To complete a task, place an `x` between the brackets.

- [ ] In `planning/wireframes.md`: add wireframes for at least three pages in your web app.
  - [ ] Include a list of pages in your app
- [ ] In `planning/entity_relationship_diagram.md`: add the entity relationship diagram you developed for your database.
  - [ ] Your entity relationship diagram should include the tables in your database.
- [X] Prepare your three-minute pitch presentation, to be presented during Unit 7 (the next unit).
  - [X] You do **not** need to submit any materials in advance of your pitch.
- [X] In this document, complete all three questions in the **Reflection** section below

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We worked steadily and kept the project moving forward in an organized, sequential way. Tasks were split reasonably well, which helped us make consistent progress. Deliverables for the unit were completed on time and with clear structure. Communication improved as we settled into a workflow that matched everyone’s availability.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had some difficulty finalizing the wireframes and getting the entity relationship diagram to reflect the app logic accurately. Coordinating schedules made collaborative edits slower than expected, which sometimes delayed decision-making. A few unclear requirements caused rework on design elements. Overall, these issues were manageable but slowed momentum at times.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

A short tutorial or checklist on wireframe best practices and ER diagram conventions would be very helpful. Guidance on common pitfalls and examples of well-structured diagrams would speed up our design iterations. Feedback on early drafts would also help us avoid rework later.
