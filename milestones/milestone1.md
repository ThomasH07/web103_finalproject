## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our group collaboration went really well. We were all excited about the project idea and quickly agreed on the core concept of blending a daily Wordle-style challenge with live multiplayer games. Brainstorming the app name and writing the "Inspiration" section felt creative and productive. We had a lot of good ideas, and dividing up the initial planning tasks like writing user stories and setting up the README.md was straightforward and everyone contributed their part.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge was narrowing down our broad initial ideas to a focused set of features that met the project's specific requirements. It was tough to prioritize and decide what to leave out. We also spent a good amount of time learning how to write effective user stories that clearly define the functionality we need to build.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Moving forward, we would appreciate some additional support with the more complex backend topics. Specifically, guidance on implementing the real-time features that allow multiple users to interact simultaneously would be very helpful. We'd also value some advice on best practices for designing an efficient database schema for our app's specific data relationships.
