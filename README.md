## About

### Description and Purpose

### Inspiration

[This project draws inspiration from several popular games and platforms, blending their best mechanics into a single, music-focused experience:

    Wordle: The core concept for the daily challenge mode is heavily inspired by Wordle. This includes the "one-puzzle-per-day" model, the 5-attempt limit, simple streak tracking, and the iconic shareable emoji grid to show off your results without spoilers.

    Heardle: The most direct predecessor for the daily game. Heardle pioneered the "Wordle-for-music" format, and this project adopts its brilliant mechanic of using progressively longer audio snippets as the primary guessing tool.

    Kahoot!: The entire live multiplayer mode is modeled after Kahoot!'s real-time, social quiz format. The idea of a host creating a custom game, sharing a simple link for friends to join, and competing against a live leaderboard comes directly from this model.

    Jackbox Games: A major influence on the "social party game" feel. The concept of creating a "room" (or session) for friends to join instantly from their own devices (phones, laptops) for a fun, real-time competition is a hallmark of the Jackbox suite.

    SongPop: A classic in the music quiz genre. Its influence is seen in the fast-paced, competitive guessing format and the deep customization of playlists based on specific genres, artists, and decades.]
